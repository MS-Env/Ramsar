# Water Area Detection in Google Earth Engine

To calculate the seasonal surface water areas of lakes and wetlands using Landsat images and an automatic water detection index, along with Otsu dynamic thresholding and the Canny edge filter, provided for the Google Earth Engine platform.
In the dataset Excel file, the surface water area of 20 Ramsar Convention lakes and wetlands located in Iran was investigated seasonally from 1986 to 2023. Additionally, the ecosystem service value of water bodies, number of prohibited plains, cumulative deficit volume of aquifers, number of large dams, total water inlet to the large dams, added value of agriculture, GDP share of agriculture, annual crop production, irrigated agriculture area, rainfed agriculture area, and agricultural water use efficiency are provided on a national scale.
